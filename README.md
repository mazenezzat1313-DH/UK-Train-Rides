Project Idea

This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting UK train rides using real-world data.
The main objectives are:

Clean and preprocess the dataset for accurate analysis.

Extract meaningful analysis questions that are valuable for decision-makers.

Build forecasting models to predict future train rides and revenue trends.

Visualize results through a Power BI dashboard and present findings in a final report.

Project Plan
Week 1: Data Model, Cleaning and Preprocessing

Tasks:

Build a data model.

Clean and preprocess the dataset.
Tools: SQL, Python (pandas, Matplotlib).
Deliverables:

Cleaned dataset ready for analysis.

Data preprocessing notebook.

Week 2: Analysis Questions Phase

Tasks:

Define and document analysis questions derived from the dataset.

Ensure questions are relevant for organizational decision-making.
Tools: SQL, Python (pandas, Matplotlib).
Deliverables:

Set of analysis questions based on dataset insights.

Week 3: Forecasting Questions Phase

Tasks:

Develop forecasting models to answer questions related to trends.

Predict number of rides for the next month.

Forecast revenue per day and demand for different ticket classes.
Tools: Python (scikit-learn, pandas, Matplotlib).
Deliverables:

Forecasting results with visualization plots.

Week 4: Visualization Dashboard and Final Presentation

Tasks:

Build an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize answers to analysis and forecasting questions.

Prepare a final report and presentation summarizing all project phases (data analysis, model development, forecasting, and visualization).
Tools: SQL, Python (pandas, Matplotlib), Power BI.
Deliverables:

Power BI visualization dashboard.

Final report and presentation.
